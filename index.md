I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) jointly supervised by [Gilles Barthe](https://gbarthe.github.io/) and [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml). My research focuses on high-performance, high-assurance post-quantum cryptographic implementations.

Previously I worked at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) as a Cybersecurity Analyst.

Between 2015 and 2020 I completed my BSc and MSc degrees in Computer Engineering at the [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN), where I specialized in Cryptography, Information Security, Parallel and Distributed Computing. I wrote my Master's thesis at the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab)](https://haslab.uminho.pt/) as part of the
[REASSURE project](http://www.cister.isep.ipp.pt/projects/reassure).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Thesis**: *TrustZone based Attestation in Secure Runtime Verification for Embedded Systems*
  [[PDF](assets/dissertation.pdf)]

During my studies I completed two internships as a Software Engineer at Closer Consulting in 2018 and as a Security Engineer at Aptoide in 2019.
