I'm a Ph.D researcher at the [Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) under the supervision
of [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter/index.shtml) and [Gilles Barthe](https://gbarthe.github.io/).

My work is focused on high performance, formally verified post-quantum cryptographic implementations (high assurance cryptography for short).

Previously I worked at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/) as a Cybersecurity Analyst.

From 2015 to 2020 I completed my Bachelors and Masters in Computer Engineering at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN).

My Master's thesis was written at the [High-Assurance Software Laboratory (HASLab)](https://haslab.uminho.pt/) as part of the
[REASSURE project](http://www.cister.isep.ipp.pt/projects/reassure).

**Thesis**: "TrustZone based Attestation in Secure Runtime Verification for Embedded Systems"
  [pdf](assets/dissertation.pdf)
**Specialisation**: Cryptography and Information Security, Parallel and Distributed Computing

**Full CV**: [pdf](assets/Short_CV.pdf)

## Non-Academic Interests
I'm an avid [endurance athlete](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4564921/), focusing on (ultra)
trail running, cycling and triathlons.
