The [Pine A64](https://linux-sunxi.org/Pine64) is a board running the [A64](https://linux-sunxi.org/A64) SoC
and comes in three different variants:

- Pine A64 512MB
- Pine A64+ 1GB
- Pine A64+ 2GB (this is the one I have)

Allwinner is the manufacturer of the A64 SoC which is a Quad-core Cortex-A53 ARM CPU and a Mali400 MP2 GPU from
ARM. The Cortex A53 implements the AArch64 architecture. 

Although Allwinner provides a BSP(Board-Support-Package), the U-Boot bootloader doesn't compile and the Linux
kernel image is patched (and outdated) so it's better to compile mainline kernel and U-Boot as support for Pine A64
is present.

## Boot Flow
OP-TEE can be booted on the Pine A64 in combination with Linux. In this setup, the boot flow is as follows:

![ARMv8 Bootflow](/assets/ARMv8_BootFlow.png)

The BootROM code, considered BL1, is loaded from the chips ROM which in turn loads the SPL responsible for
initializing DRAM and loading OP-TEE, ARM-TF and U-Boot to memory. The processor then branches to ARM-TF
which first loads OP-TEE and then hands control over to U-Boot, the normal world bootloader, which will load
the normal world kernel.


## Firmware
The Pine A64 firmware is made up of four different parts:
- The on-chip Boot-ROM (BROM), which is the first code to be executed and cannot be modified
- A **S**econdary **P**rogram **L**oader (SPL) responsible for initializing DRAM and loading the remaining
  firmware parts. This component is part of U-Boot
- EL3 runtime firmware (**i.e** ARM TF-A), support for A64 SoC is present in mainline
- U-Boot bootloader for loading kernels and data; support for A64 is present in upstream


## Build
This document takes all the components from mainline/upstream, instead of the ones provided by Sunxi.


## Tooling
To build the different components (ARM TF-A, U-Boot, Linux), setup a cross compilation toolchain and add the binaries
to the PATH env variable:

```
export PATH=$PATH:<path to aarch64 binaries>:<path to aarch32 binaries>
export CROSS_COMPILE="ccache aarch64-linux-gnu-"
```

- U-Boot requires `swig`, `python-dev` and `device-tree-compiler` packages to be present on the system.
- Linux kernel modules require `kmod` to be installed.


## ARM TF-A
ARM Trusted Firmware is responsible for the EL3 runtime secure monitor in the Pine A64, switching between the secure
and normal world, S-EL1 and EL1. The following sequence of commands is enough to compile it for the Pine A64:

```
git clone https://review.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a
cd trusted-firmware-a
git checkout <latest stable release> (e.g. v2.2)
make PLAT=sun50i_a64 SPD=opteed DEBUG=1 bl31
export BL31=$(pwd)/build/sun50i_a64/debug/bl31.bin
```


## OPTEE
OP-TEE is made up of two essential components, the (secure) OS itself, OPTEE OS, and a client
which will run in the normal world and interact with OPTEE OS via the OPTEE driver provided
by the (Linux) kernel.

### OPTEE OS
```
git clone https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os.git -b <latest stable release> (e.g. 3.8.0)
cd optee_os
make CFG_ARM64_CORE=y \
    CFG_TEE_LOGLEVEL=4 \
    CFG_TEE_CORE_LOG_LEVEL=4 \
    CROSS_COMPILE32="ccache arm-linux-gnueabihf-" \
    CROSS_COMPILE64="ccache aarch64-linux-gnu-" \
    DEBUG=1 \
    PLATFORM=sunxi-sun50i_a64
export TEE=$(pwd)/out/arm-plat-sunxi/core/tee-pager_v2.bin
```
The file pointed to by **TEE** is a RAW ARM executable which will be branched to by ARM TF-A.


### OPTEE Client
```
git clone https://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_client -b <latest stable release> (e.g. 3.8.0)
cd optee_client
make
cd out/export
tar -cfv optee_client.tar.gz usr
```
The resutling tar archive should be placed in the [root partition](#rootfs) in the respective subdirectories.

## U-Boot
U-Boot is the normal world bootloader, however the repo also includes a SPL which will be loaded by BL1.

### Modifications
The binary image built for the Pine A64+ board in mainline U-Boot doesn't load OPTEE, thus the
script used to generate the Device Tree Binary must be patched. The [patched version](/assets/mksunxi_fit_atf_optee.sh) 
should be copied to `board/sunxi/mksunxi_fit_atf.sh`

```
git clone https://gitlab.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot.git
cd u-boot
git checkout <latest stable release> (e.g. v2020.04-rc3)
make pine64_plus_defconfig
make 
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/tools/
```

The SPL, U-Boot plus TF-A and OP-TEE are packaged in `u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin` which will later be flashed
before the first partition of the SD Card at an 8Kb offset:
```
dd if=u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin of=/dev/sdx bs=1k seek=8
```

## Linux
### Modifications
The mainline kernel provides enought support for a headless setup of the Pine A64 (**e.g.**: serial + ssh),
however in order for the HDMI output to work and the OP-TEE driver to be loaded at boot, some modifications
must be introduced.
1. The default kernel configuration for the Pine A64+ board doesn't enable the Mali400 GPU driver, so it
   must be enabled manually via the menuconfig target when running `make menuconfig`, after step **3**.
2. Modify the DTS (Device Tree Source) file in `arch/arm64/boot/dts/allwinner/sun50i-a64-pine64-plus.dts`
   to include the following block:
   ```
   firmware {
       optee {
        compatible = "linaro,optee-tz";
        method = "smc";
       };
   };
   ```
   which enables the kernel to identify and load the OP-TEE at boot time.

### Steps
1. Clone the mainline repo, latest version
```
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git -b v5.6 --depth=1
cd linux
```

2. Replace the DT source for the Pine A64, in `arch/arm64/boot/dts` with the 
   [new one](/assets/sun50i-a64-pine64-plus.dts)

3. Generate a configuration: `make ARCH=arm64 defconfig`

4. Create the kernel image: `make ARCH=arm64  -j2 Image` which is placed in
   `arch/arm64/boot/`

5. Compile the device tree for the Pine A64: `make ARCH=arm64 -j2 dtbs`; the
   dtb file will be placed in `arch/arm64/boot/dts/`
   
6. Compile the kernel modules which include the Mali 400 GPU driver needed for HDMI output:
   ```
   make -j2 ARCH=arm64 modules
   make -j2 ARCH=arm64 INSTALL_MOD_PATH=modules modules modules_install
   ```

6. Create a tar archive with the kernel modules `tar -czf modules.tar.gz modules`


## Partitioning the SD Card
Partitioning the SD card can be achievied by running the following sequence of commands:

```
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1M count=1

blockdev -rereadpt /dev/sdX

cat <<EOT | sfdisk /dev/sdX
2M,32M,c
,,L
EOT

mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2
```


## U-Boot Configuration
U-Boot is configured via a file, `boot.cmd`, which will be wrapped by a U-boot header.  To configure U-Boot:

1. Mount the boot partition `/dev/sdX1` in `/mnt` and create the `boot.cmd` file as such:

```
fatload mmc 0 0x46000000 Image
fatload mmc 0 0x49000000 sun50i-a64-pine64-plus.dtb

setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200 console=tty1 earlyprintk root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootwait panic=10

booti 0x46000000 - 0x49000000
```

2. Copy the kernel `Image` and the device tree `<board>.dtb` to the boot partition and run: `mkimage -C none
   -A arm64 -T script -d boot.cmd boot.scr`


## Rootfs
There are several utilities to create a root filesystem, `deboostrap` is one such tool.  Mount the root
partition `/dev/sdX2` in `/mnt`:

1. Use `debootstrap` to install a Debian base system on the root partition
2. Chroot into the mounted partition, using qemu: `chroot /mnt /usr/bin/qemu-aarch64-static /bin/sh -i`
3. Run `/deboostrap/deboostrap --second-stage`


## Kernel Modules
With the boot partition mounted on `/mnt`:
1. Extract the modules from the tar archive `tar -xf modules.tar.gz`
2. Copy the modules to the root filesystem `cp -r modules/lib/ /mnt/lib`
